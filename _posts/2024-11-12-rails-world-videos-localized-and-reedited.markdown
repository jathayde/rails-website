Hi everyone!

We're pleased to announce that thanks to Rails World sponsor Happy Scribe, all Rails World 2024 videos are now available with **Japanese**, **Brazilian Portuguese**, and **Spanish** subtitles. 

<a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/">Happy Scribe</a> is a transcription and subtitling service built on Rails, and when they reached out about sponsoring Rails World earlier this year, I had just returned from Tropical on Rails in Brazil, where many community members there asked me about localizing Rails content in other languages.

While translating and maintaining the Rails Guides presents a host of long-term challenges, these conversations did make me think. When Happy Scribe got in touch, the answer fell into our lap. We agreed to make Rails World 2024 a trial for localizing Rails World videos.

We chose languages from two regions where Rails is popular, but English is _a little less_ widely spoken: Brazil and Japan. Happy Scribe then surprised us by also providing Spanish subtitles since Spanish is so widely spoken in the world.

We hope this removes a barrier and makes Rails World videos accessible to a wider audience of Rails enthusiasts around the world. 

Huge thanks again to Happy Scribe for making this possible!

**Videos re-edited**

We've also re-edited almost all of the videos to place greater focus on the slides and code on screen. These new versions are now live, so thanks to everyone who sent in feedback.

Please let us know what you think in the comments under the videos!
