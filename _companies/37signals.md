  37signals built Basecamp and HEY on Rails, and the 37signals team often builds and tests new features in-house before contributing them back to the framework. Examples include Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus) for server-driven UI, Propshaft for asset management, and Solid Queue for background job processing. They’ve also shifted toward self-hosting, deploying with Kamal, their Docker-based deployment tool.
