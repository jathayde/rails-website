  37signals is the birthplace of Rails, which was started in 2003 to build Basecamp.

The company also makes HEY, an email and calendar system, and ONCE, for self-hosted SaaS, and has shared its development process Shape Up.

  37signals built Rails for Basecamp and has since used it to create all their web products. The team often builds and tests new features in-house before contributing them back to the framework. Examples include Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus) for server-rendered UI, Propshaft for asset management, and Solid Queue for background job processing. Theyâ€™ve also shifted toward self-hosting, deploying with Kamal, their Docker-based deployment tool.
member_status: "In 2022, 37signals became a **founding Core member** of the Rails Foundation. David Heinemeier Hansson, 37signals co-founder and CTO and creator of Ruby on Rails, is the chairman of the foundation."
