name: Cookpad Inc.
intro: |
  Cookpad provides a global platform for recipe sharing and search, used in 67 countries and regions, in 26 languages. Our mission is to make everyday cooking fun, because we see a brighter future. And we believe that the power of cooking will get us there. Cooking isn’t just a matter of putting together ingredients. When you cook, you choose. You choose what to buy, what to eat, and how to nourish yourself, your family, and friends. You choose how to give back to communities. When you cook, you choose to become a maker of tomorrow’s world. Here at Cookpad, each day is about inspiring more people to make these choices.

  The Cookpad platform is a Rails monolith and having moved to Rails early in 2007 has a long history of growing along with the framework, scaling to serve 100M monthly active users. The Cookpad website, internal tools, and API’s that power the native apps are all powered by Rails. We love Hotwire and are embracing Turbo and Stimulus on the front end.
