  Gusto has built a robust technology stack over the past decade centered around Ruby on Rails, which serves as the framework for all customer-facing applications. With an impressive history of over 250,000 commits, Gusto stands out as one of the largest users of Rails in the industry.<br><br>
  The architecture consists of two major monolithic applications supported by many smaller applications, all of which communicate seamlessly via Kafka, utilizing the [Karafka](https://karafka.io) gem. Gusto also uses [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org) to process over 150 million jobs daily, showcasing their commitment to performance and scalability.<br><br>
  To improve maintainability and promote agility, Gusto is progressively modularizing its codebase by adopting [Packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk), which facilitates a more flexible development environment. Additionally, Gusto is focused on service extraction and enhancing the functionality of its smaller applications, further streamlining development processes and improving overall developer productivity.<br><br>
  On the frontend, Gusto has invested heavily in a single-page application (SPA) architecture, which is integrated with the Rails backend using GraphQL.<br><br>
  By leveraging the strengths of Ruby on Rails, Kafka, Sidekiq, GraphQL, and modern frontend technologies, Gusto continues to deliver powerful solutions that meet the evolving needs of their customers.
pull_quote: "Rails is at the center of a vibrant ecosystem and community of thousands of people and companies contributing to it in one way or another. As a company that relies heavily on Rails, Gusto benefits enormously from this ecosystem. As a Rails Foundation member, we’re proud to support the continued healthy growth of the framework and the community that powers it. It’s an investment not just in the technology we use today, but in the future we’re helping to build together."
