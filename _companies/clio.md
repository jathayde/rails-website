Today, their product suite is the largest and most sophisticated Rails-based system in the legal industry, processing millions of transactions daily. <br><br>With a team of over 300 engineers, Clio maintains a robust ecosystem of multiple Rails monoliths that serve as the foundation of its product suite. These monoliths power both web and mobile applications, ensuring a seamless experience for customers across all platforms. Clio employs modern Rails practices, such as modular architecture, advanced testing frameworks, and optimized database handling, to ensure their platform remains efficient and adaptable as it evolves.
pull_quote: |
  Rails stood out for its emphasis on developer experience&mdash;Ruby was a beautiful programming language, and Rails was a straight forward framework for building web apps. Early on in adopting Ruby on Rails we could see how it immediately led to greater productivity and impact. Its "convention over configuration" approach freed developers from the burden of boilerplate code, allowing them to focus on solving real problems. For Clio, this meant the ability to prototype and iterate quickly, creating a platform that could meet the needs of the legal industry. <br><br>Rails has been at the core of Clio's success ever since, and joining the Rails Foundation is our way of giving back to a community that has given us so much. We're proud to be a home for Rails developers, a part of the thriving ecosystem of companies built on Rails, and an active contributor to its future.
